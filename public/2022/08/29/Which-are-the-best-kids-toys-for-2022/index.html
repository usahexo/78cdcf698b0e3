With so many options on the market, it can be tough to decide which one is right for your family. But never fear! We’ve got you covered with our list of the best kids toys for 2022.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sphero Bolt</li>
</ol>
<p>This electric robot is perfect for imaginative kids who love to play in “virtual worlds”. The Bolt is controlled by a phone or tablet, and kids can use it to interact with games, movies, and other apps. It’s also great for learning basic coding skills.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Anki Drive</li>
</ol>
<p>This racing game is a blast for both kids and parents alike! Pit your toy cars against each other using your smartphone or tablet as a controller – the faster and more strategic you play, the more fun you’ll have.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra XDI</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re looking for a tablet alternative that’s perfect for little ones, look no further than the LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra XDI. This device is durable enough to take whatever your child can throw at it, and comes preloaded with educational games and activities that will help them learn new skills.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Sphero R2-D2</li>
</ol>
<p>This adorable Sphero droid isn’t just for Star Wars fans – anyone who loves gadgets and tech will have a blast playing with R2-D2. He responds to voice commands, rolls around autonomously, and even projects holograms from Star Wars episodes IV-VI. How cool is that?</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>VTech Kidizoom Duo Camera</li>
</ol>
<p> If your child loves photography (or just pretending to take pictures), the Kidizoom Duo Camera is a must-have toy this year. This digital camera comes with editing software so kids can easily create their own masterpieces, plus built-in games and activities to keep them entertained while they’re learning.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-latest-trends-in-kids-toys-for-2022"><a href="#What-are-the-latest-trends-in-kids-toys-for-2022" class="headerlink" title="What are the latest trends in kids toys for 2022?"></a>What are the latest trends in kids toys for 2022?</h1><p>There are many new and upcoming trends in kids toys for the year 2022. Some of these include augmented reality, AI and voice-controlled toys, and more creative and open-ended toys.</p>
<p>One of the biggest toy trends for 2022 is going to be Augmented Reality (AR). AR is a technology that combines real-world objects with digital content, such as images, videos, or text. This allows users to interact with the digital content by using their surroundings as a backdrop. For example, you could point your phone’s camera at a building and see information about it pop up on the screen.</p>
<p>This technology is already being used in some toys, such as the Mattel View-Master VR Starter Pack. This pack comes with a View-Master VR viewer and a selection of experience discs that let you explore different virtual worlds. Other companies are also developing AR toys, so look out for these in the near future.</p>
<p>Another big trend for 2022 is AI (Artificial Intelligence). AI allows toys to learn and adapt to the child’s preferences and personality. For example, the FurReal Ricky robot dog is able to respond to over 100 voice commands, recognize different family members, and even play fetch.</p>
<p>AI toys are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to provide a more personal experience for children. They can also help teach children important skills such as problem-solving and creativity. Look out for more AI toys in the future!</p>
<p>A third trend for 2022 is voice-controlled toys. These are toys that can be controlled using voice commands instead of buttons or switches. The most popular voice-controlled toy at the moment is the Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition, which is a small speaker that responds to voice commands from Amazon’s Alexa assistant.</p>
<p>Voice-controlled toys have several benefits over traditional toy controls. Firstly, they are easier for young children to use as they don’t need to learn how to use complicated buttons or switches. Secondly, they can help children develop their communication skills as they learn how to give clear instructions to the toy. Finally, they are fun and engaging for kids!</p>
<p>Other trends in kids toys for 2022 include:</p>
<h1 id="What-were-some-of-the-best-selling-kids-toys-in-2021"><a href="#What-were-some-of-the-best-selling-kids-toys-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="What were some of the best-selling kids toys in 2021?"></a>What were some of the best-selling kids toys in 2021?</h1><p>The best-selling toys for kids in 2021 were the usual mix of dolls, action figures, and video games. But there were a few surprises on the list, including a robotic dog that could be controlled with an app and a set of color-changing blocks.</p>
<p>The top-selling toy of the year was the Barbie Dreamhouse, which had been a perennial favorite for years. The Dreamhouse is a three-story mansion with numerous accessories, and it can be customized to fit each girl’s individual style.</p>
<p>Another popular toy was the Hatchimals Surprise. These little creatures hatch from eggs, and each one is different. Kids can raise them and watch them grow, teaching them about the responsibilities of taking care of a pet.</p>
<p>The Luvabella doll was another bestseller. This interactive doll responds to touch and voice, making her feel like a real baby. She can even learn to speak new languages!</p>
<p>Other popular toys included the Lego Dimensions Starter Pack (a set of blocks that can be used to build various objects and structures), the NEOS360 robot pet (a robot dog that can be controlled with an app), and the Annoying Orange Slice Set (a set of color-changing blocks that makes irritating noises when you step on them).</p>
<h1 id="Which-kids-toys-are-most-popular-with-boys"><a href="#Which-kids-toys-are-most-popular-with-boys" class="headerlink" title="Which kids toys are most popular with boys?"></a>Which kids toys are most popular with boys?</h1><p>When it comes to choosing the perfect toy for a boy, there are a few things to take into consideration. Boys can be tough to shop for, as they often have different interests than girls. The good news is that there are plenty of great toys on the market that boys will love.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most popular kids toys for boys:</p>
<p>action figures</p>
<p>cars and trucks</p>
<p>building blocks</p>
<p>remote control cars and planes</p>
<p>sports equipment</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>The action figure is always a popular choice for boys. Whether they’re into dinosaurs, superheroes or aliens, there’s an action figure out there for them. Another classic choice for boys is the car or truck. From Hot Wheels to Matchbox cars, these vehicles never go out of style. Building blocks are also a hit with boys, as they allow them to be creative and use their imaginations. Remote control cars and planes are another favorite, especially when it comes to outdoor play. And finally, who can resist the lure of video games? Many boys love nothing more than spending hours glued to the TV screen playing their favorite game.</p>
<h1 id="Which-kids-toys-are-most-popular-with-girls"><a href="#Which-kids-toys-are-most-popular-with-girls" class="headerlink" title="Which kids toys are most popular with girls?"></a>Which kids toys are most popular with girls?</h1><p>There is no definitive answer to this question as what might be popular with one girl might not be popular with another. However, there are a few toys that are typically more popular with girls than boys.</p>
<p>One example is dolls. Dolls have been around for centuries and continue to be one of the most popular toys for girls. There are all sorts of different dolls available, from princesses and Barbies to superheroes and monsters. Girls often enjoy playing with dolls because they can pretend to be someone else, or act out scenes from their favorite movies or TV shows.</p>
<p>Another toy that is often popular with girls is makeup. Girls love experimenting with different colors and shades, and makeup can help them feel more confident about their appearance. There are also plenty of makeup kits on the market that allow girls to create realistic-looking facial features.</p>
<p>Some other popular toys for girls include:</p>
<p>-Barbie dolls<br>-Superhero action figures<br>-Princess costumes<br>-Play kitchens<br>-Dress-up clothes</p>
