            <h1 id="Microgaming-BigTimeMG-Adds-Bitcoin-Option-for-Gambling-Establishments"><a href="#Microgaming-BigTimeMG-Adds-Bitcoin-Option-for-Gambling-Establishments" class="headerlink" title="Microgaming BigTimeMG Adds Bitcoin Option for Gambling Establishments"></a>Microgaming BigTimeMG Adds Bitcoin Option for Gambling Establishments</h1><p>The software company Microgaming has announced that it is adding a bitcoin-based gambling platform to its BigTimeMG suite. The move is set to provide a secure and convenient option for both casinos and customers alike.</p>
<p>BigTimeMG is an existing gaming solution that offers dealers and players a single interface for managing all their gaming activities. With the new bitcoin option, casinos will be able to take advantage of the cryptocurrency’s fast and secure transactions, without having to worry about the potential volatility of the currency markets.</p>
<p>Customers will also appreciate the convenience of using bitcoin, as well as the added security of knowing that their transactions are not subject to government or financial institution scrutiny. In addition, Microgaming has announced that it will be providing a casino bonus in bitcoin to celebrate the launch of the new platform.</p>
<p>This news comes at a time when interest in bitcoin is reaching fever pitch. The cryptocurrency’s value has been on a steady upward trend for most of 2017, with occasional spikes and dips. This volatility may concern some people who are not familiar with investing, but it could also provide opportunities for savvy investors looking to make a quick profit.</p>
<p>For those who want to invest in bitcoin but don’t want to bother with the intricacies of trading, there are now a number of online services that allow you to buy bitcoins with your credit card or bank account. Once you have your bitcoins, you can use them to purchase goods and services online, or you can hold onto them in hopes that their value will continue to increase.</p>
<h1 id="Bitcoin-Friendly-Microgaming-BigTimeMG-Offers-Free-Play-and-Instant-Transactions"><a href="#Bitcoin-Friendly-Microgaming-BigTimeMG-Offers-Free-Play-and-Instant-Transactions" class="headerlink" title="Bitcoin-Friendly Microgaming BigTimeMG Offers Free Play and Instant Transactions"></a>Bitcoin-Friendly Microgaming BigTimeMG Offers Free Play and Instant Transactions</h1><p>Bitcoin-friendly BigTimeMG offers free play and instant transactions. The Malta-based online casino is a subsidiary of the respected Microgaming software development company.</p>
<p>BigTimeMG has been operational since early 2016, and offers a wide range of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and baccarat. The casino also offers progressive jackpots worth millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Players can enjoy BigTimeMG’s games for free by taking advantage of the casino’s generous practice mode feature. There is no need to download any software or provide any personal information. Instant transactions ensure that there is no waiting period for players who want to enjoy real money gambling action.</p>
<p>BigTimeMG is licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority and the UK Gambling Commission. Both licensing authorities are highly respected in the online gambling community. The casino uses state-of-the-art SSL encryption technology to protect player data and funds.</p>
<p>BigTimeMG offers customer support in a variety of languages, including English, German, Spanish, French, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, and Italian.</p>
<h1 id="Microgaming-Goes-All-In-with-Bitcoin-Friendly-Casino-Platform"><a href="#Microgaming-Goes-All-In-with-Bitcoin-Friendly-Casino-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Microgaming Goes All In with Bitcoin-Friendly Casino Platform"></a>Microgaming Goes All In with Bitcoin-Friendly Casino Platform</h1><p>Online gaming behemoth Microgaming has announced the launch of a new casino platform that allows players to bet and win in Bitcoin. The new platform, which is called Quickfire, will enable casinos that use Microgaming’s software to offer Bitcoin gaming to their customers.</p>
<p>Quickfire is designed to provide a more streamlined and user-friendly experience for players, as well as an easy way for casinos to add Bitcoin gaming to their offerings. According to Microgaming, the new platform has already been adopted by a number of major online casinos, including Betway and Mr Green.</p>
<p>Microgaming has been at the forefront of online gaming since it launched the first online casino in 1994. The company has been quick to adopt new technologies, such as mobile gaming and Bitcoin, and its new Quickfire platform is further evidence of its commitment to innovation.</p>
<p>The introduction of Bitcoin-friendly gambling could not come at a better time for Microgaming. The global interest in Bitcoin is reaching fever pitch, and with good reason; the digital currency offers many advantages over traditional forms of payment. These advantages include speed, security, and anonymity.</p>
<p>Players who use Quickfire will be able to take advantage of all these benefits when they gamble online. In addition, they will also enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing that their transactions are being processed by one of the most reputable names in online gaming.</p>
<h1 id="Bitcoin-Gambling-How-Much-Does-it-Cost-to-Set-Up-a-Casino"><a href="#Bitcoin-Gambling-How-Much-Does-it-Cost-to-Set-Up-a-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Bitcoin Gambling: How Much Does it Cost to Set Up a Casino?"></a>Bitcoin Gambling: How Much Does it Cost to Set Up a Casino?</h1><p>Bitcoin gambling is gradually becoming more popular as the currency gains mainstream traction. But what are the costs associated with setting up a bitcoin casino?</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to go about setting up a bitcoin casino. The most common approach is to simply create a website that allows users to gamble with bitcoin. This can be done relatively cheaply and simply, but there are some costs associated with it.</p>
<p>Domain name and hosting: A domain name and hosting account will likely run you around $100 per year.</p>
<p>SSL certificate: A SSL certificate is required to ensure secure connections between your website and its users. This will cost around $50-100 per year.</p>
<p>Bitcoin payment processor: To accept payments, you’ll need a bitcoin payment processor. These services typically charge a small percentage of each transaction (around 1-2%).</p>
<p>Third-party game providers: If you want to offer games other than blackjack and roulette, you’ll need to work with a third-party provider. Fees for this vary, but can be as high as 30% of revenue generated.</p>
<p>So, on average, it costs around $250-$300 per year to set up and run a bitcoin casino. This isn’t prohibitively expensive, but it’s important to be aware of these costs before starting your own casino.</p>
<h1 id="Microgaming-Introduces-New-Bitcoin-Casino-Software-–-BigTimeMG"><a href="#Microgaming-Introduces-New-Bitcoin-Casino-Software-–-BigTimeMG" class="headerlink" title="Microgaming Introduces New Bitcoin Casino Software – BigTimeMG"></a>Microgaming Introduces New Bitcoin Casino Software – BigTimeMG</h1><p>Microgaming, the world’s largest provider of online gaming software, has just announced the launch of its new Bitcoin casino software – BigTimeMG.</p>
<p>The new software platform is designed to help operators easily launch a Bitcoin casino and provides them with all the necessary tools and features required to run a successful gaming site.

<p>Some of the key benefits of using BigTimeMG include:</p>

<p>*A wide selection of games including slots, table games, video poker, and more</p>
