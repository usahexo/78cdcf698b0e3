<p>There are a few factors that go into this equation, including game choice and betting limits. When playing Speed Baccarat 2, for example, you generally need to wager around $200 per hour in order to get noticed by the casino hosts.</p>
<p>This is because Baccarat is one of their more popular games, and they want to ensure that those who are playing it are doing so with a serious intent. If you’re looking to play a different game, such as blackjack or poker, then your required bet size may be lower.</p>
<p>In most cases, though, you’ll need to make bets ranging from $25 to $50 in order to get the attention of the dealers and casino staff. This isn’t a hard and fast rule, but it’s a good place to start if you want your odds of getting comped enhanced.</p>

Leading the charge is Wynn Macau, which has just unveiled its new Baccarat Salon.</p>
<p>The 12,000-square-foot facility is complete with red-carpet treatment for players. They can expect VIP service, exclusive gaming areas and luxurious surroundings. The salon is part of Wynn Macau’s $4 billion expansion project, which is scheduled for completion later this year.</p>
<p>Baccarat is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and Macau is the industry’s largest market. In recent years, however, it has been overshadowed by booming markets in countries such as Cambodia and Vietnam. To stay competitive, Macau casinos are investing heavily in new facilities and amenities.</p>
<p>Wynn Macau isn’t the only casino making big moves in the baccarat market. Galaxy Entertainment Group recently opened a new luxury baccarat hall at its flagship property in Macau. The 30,000-square-foot hall offers seating for up to 400 players and comes complete with high-roller rooms and private gaming salons.</p>
<p>The increased competition is good news for baccarat players, who can now enjoy even more luxurious amenities at some of the world’s top casinos. So if you’re looking for a high-end gaming experience, be sure to check out Wynn Macau or Galaxy Entertainment Group’s latest offerings.</p>

<p>The complimentary room offer is good for either the Player’s Choice or Carnival Tower. The offer is based on availability and other restrictions may apply.</p>
<p>“We are really excited about our new Speed Baccarat tournament,” said tournament director Butch Clemons. “It is a great opportunity for players to experience our new player-friendly environment while enjoying some fantastic prizes.”</p>
<p>The Speed Baccarat tournament begins on Saturday, September 8 and continues through Sunday, September 16. Players have the chance to win their share of $10,000 in prize money, including a top prize of $2,500.</p>

<p>The promotion is open to all Resort Rewards members, and all they have to do is earn 15,000 tier credits playing Speed Baccarat 2 at any of the participating casinos. These credits can be earned between now and October 31st, 2018.</p>
<p>Once the member has earned the required tier credits, they simply need to present their Resort Rewards card at the Harrah’s New Orleans Casino front desk to redeem their free one-night stay. Up to two guests per registered room are also eligible for the free night, making it a great opportunity for a weekend getaway.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions of course - the free night must be used within 60 days of earning the tier credits, and blackout dates apply. But with so many casinos in the Resort Rewards network, there’s likely a participating property that’s close by.</p>
<p>This latest promotion from Resort Rewards underscores how much value members can get by taking advantage of everything the program has to offer. In addition to free nights at partner hotels, there are also complimentary show tickets, discounts on food and beverage, and now even free casino play.</p>
<p>It’s easy to sign up for Resort Rewards - just visit the website and enter your information. And if you’re already a member, be sure to check out the promo page for all the latest offers.</p>
