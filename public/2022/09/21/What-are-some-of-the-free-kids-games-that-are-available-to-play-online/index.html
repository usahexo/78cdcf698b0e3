            <h1 id="What-are-some-of-the-free-kids-games-that-are-available-to-play-online"><a href="#What-are-some-of-the-free-kids-games-that-are-available-to-play-online" class="headerlink" title="What are some of the free kids games that are available to play online?"></a>What are some of the free kids games that are available to play online?</h1><p>There are a number of free kids games that are available to play online. Some of the most popular games include racing games, puzzle games, and action games.</p>
<p>One of the most popular free kids games is racing games. Racing games are a great way to teach kids about spatial awareness and hand-eye coordination. Some of the most popular racing games include Mario Kart, Sonic The Hedgehog, and Crash Team Racing.</p>
<p>Another popular type of free kids game is puzzle games. Puzzle games are a great way to teach kids problem solving skills. Some of the most popular puzzle games include Cut The Rope, Angry Birds, and Plants vs Zombies.</p>
<p>Finally, action games are also popular among kids. Action games teach hand-eye coordination and reaction time. Some of the most popular action games include Halo, Battlefield 3, and Gears Of War.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-I-know-if-a-game-is-appropriate-for-my-child"><a href="#How-do-I-know-if-a-game-is-appropriate-for-my-child" class="headerlink" title="How do I know if a game is appropriate for my child?"></a>How do I know if a game is appropriate for my child?</h1><p>There are a few things to take into account when trying to decide if a game is appropriate for your child. The first is the rating of the game. Age ratings can be found on the back of most video game boxes and range from Early Childhood, which is typically appropriate for ages 3 and up, to Mature, which is typically appropriate for ages 17 and up.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider is the content of the game. Some games may be too violent or scary for younger children. If you’re not sure what a game is about, it’s best to do some research online or check with reviews from other parents.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s important to remember that not all games are appropriate for all children. What one child might find appropriate another child might find too challenging or frustrating. You know your child best so use your judgement when choosing a game for them to play.</p>
<h1 id="What-mechanisms-are-in-place-to-ensure-that-children-are-playing-age-appropriate-games"><a href="#What-mechanisms-are-in-place-to-ensure-that-children-are-playing-age-appropriate-games" class="headerlink" title="What mechanisms are in place to ensure that children are playing age-appropriate games?"></a>What mechanisms are in place to ensure that children are playing age-appropriate games?</h1><p>Most game consoles have an age rating system in place to ensure that children are playing age-appropriate games. The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) assigns ratings to video games and mobile apps, which range from Early Childhood (EC) to Adults Only (AO). These ratings are determined by the content of the game, such as violence, sexual content, and drugs and alcohol use.</p>
<p>The ESRB also provides parents with a variety of resources to help them choose appropriate games for their children, including an overview of each rating, the type of content that is rated, and why the game received that rating. Parents can also search for games based on their own personal preferences. For example, they can choose games that are family-friendly or educational.</p>
<p>In addition to the ESRB, some game platforms have their own age rating systems. For example, Apple has its own App Store rating system that includes five categories: 4+, 9+, 12+, 17+, and 18+. These categories correspond to the ages for which the app is appropriate. Like the ESRB ratings, these categories include a brief explanation of why the app received its rating.</p>
<p>Parents should also be aware of other ways to keep their children safe while playing video games. Many games allow players to interact with one another online. It is important for parents to monitor their children’s activity on these platforms and set appropriate boundaries. Additionally, some games allow players to purchase in-game items with real money. Parents should make sure that their children are aware of these transactions and only allow them to spend money they have earned themselves.</p>
<h1 id="What-parental-controls-are-available-for-limiting-or-blocking-children’s-access-to-certain-games"><a href="#What-parental-controls-are-available-for-limiting-or-blocking-children’s-access-to-certain-games" class="headerlink" title="What parental controls are available for limiting or blocking children’s access to certain games?"></a>What parental controls are available for limiting or blocking children’s access to certain games?</h1><p>One of the concerns for parents when it comes to their children using technology is how to limit or block their access to certain games. There are a few different parental controls that can be used for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restricting App Store purchases - On an iPhone or iPad, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Restrictions and turn on “Restrictions.” You can then choose which apps your child can and can’t use and make in-app purchases.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Device passcodes - If you don’t want your child to be able to access your device at all, you can set a device passcode. To do this on an iPhone or iPad, go to Settings &gt; Passcode (or Touch ID &amp; Passcode). Then, turn off “Simple Passcode” and create a longer passcode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Blocking websites with content filters - Some internet service providers (ISPs) offer parental controls that let you block certain websites. You can also buy a router that has built-in parental controls, or install software on your computer that blocks websites.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Turning off location services - Some apps use location services to track where you are. This can be turned off in the settings of your device. On an iPhone or iPad, go to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location Services and turn off “Location Services” for the app you don’t want using your location.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="How-can-I-tell-if-a-game-my-child-is-playing-is-actually-educational"><a href="#How-can-I-tell-if-a-game-my-child-is-playing-is-actually-educational" class="headerlink" title="How can I tell if a game my child is playing is actually educational?"></a>How can I tell if a game my child is playing is actually educational?</h1><p>It can be tough to tell whether a game is actually educational or not. Many games may seem educational, but in reality they are just filled with mini-games that have no educational value. Sometimes it’s hard to determine whether a game is good for your child or not, but with a few simple tips you can figure out whether a game is actually good for their development.</p>
<p>The first step is to take a look at the rating of the game. Games that are specifically labelled as “educational” will typically have a higher rating than games that are simply marketed as “family-friendly”. This doesn’t always mean that the educational games are better, but it is a good starting point.</p>
<p>Next, take a look at what type of gameplay the game offers. Are there any mini-games or other activities that don’t seem to have any educational value? If so, then the game may not be worth purchasing. However, if the game features puzzles, problem-solving skills, and creative tasks then it is likely to be more beneficial.</p>
<p>Finally, take a look at how much screen time the child will be getting with this game. Most experts agree that children should only spend around 2 hours per day in front of screens, whether that be TV, laptops, or smartphones. If the game will cause them to exceed this limit then it may not be the best choice for them.</p>
