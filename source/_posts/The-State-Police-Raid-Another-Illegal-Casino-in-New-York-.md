#  The State Police Raid Another Illegal Casino in New York 

The state police raid another illegal casino in New York. This time, the casino is located in a small town in upstate New York.

The police arrive at the casino shortly after midnight and start to clear out the guests and employees. They arrest 10 people, including the owner of the casino.

This is the third illegal casino that has been raided by the state police in the past month. The police say that they are cracking down on these casinos because they are a danger to the community. They claim that the casinos are associated with organized crime and other criminal activities.

The owner of the casino denies any connection to organized crime and says that he was just trying to make a living. He vows to fight the charges against him.

The state police say that they will continue to crack down on illegal casinos and that anyone caught operating one will be arrested.

#  Attorney General Enforces Wagering Laws at New York Casinos 

Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood recently announced enforcement actions against two casinos in New York for violating the state’s gambling laws.

The first casino, the Monticello Casino and Raceway, allegedly allowed players to place bets after the racetrack had closed for the day. The second casino, the Resorts World Casino in Queens, was accused of allowing players to cash out their winnings before they had completed all of the required wagers.

In a statement, Attorney General Underwood said that “our office will take swift action against any casino that tries to skirt our gambling laws.” She added that “these enforcement actions make clear that we are committed to ensuring a fair and level playing field for all New Yorkers who visit our state’s casinos.”

Both casinos have agreed to pay fines totaling $45,000. The Monticello Casino and Raceway has also agreed to stop allowing bets after the racetrack has closed for the day.

#  Justice Department Cracks Down on Illegal Gambling in New York 

Illegal gambling has been a problem in New York for years. The Justice Department is cracking down, however, and last week arrested more than two dozen people accused of running an illegal gambling ring.

The gambling ring was based in Brooklyn, and operated out of a social club called the "Gentlemen's Club." The club was allegedly used as a front for a high-stakes poker game that took place twice a week. Participants paid an entrance fee of $1,000, and the games typically lasted all day.

The arrests were made as part of a larger crackdown on illegal gambling in New York. In total, law enforcement officials have shut down six illegal gaming operations in the past month. They are also investigating several other clubs that may be involved in illegal gambling.

Some observers say that the crackdown is long overdue. "Illegal gambling has been rampant in this city for years," said one state senator. "It's good to see the Justice Department finally taking action."

Others argue that the crackdown will only drive the activity underground, making it harder to track and enforce. "You can't just shut these places down and expect everything to go away," said one defense lawyer. "These games will continue to happen, but they'll just be harder to find."

At any rate, it seems clear that the Justice Department is determined to crack down on illegal gambling in New York. Whether that will be successful in rooting out the problem remains to be seen.

#  Governor Announces Increased Enforcement of Wagering Laws in New York 

Governor Cuomo has announced a stepped up effort to enforce New York's gambling laws. The announcement comes as no surprise, given the recent growth of the illegal gambling industry in the state.

Illegal gambling has been on the rise in New York in recent years, as online casinos and sports betting have become more popular. This has led to a significant increase in crime and corruption, as organized crime groups move into the space.

Governor Cuomo has vowed to crack down on illegal gambling, and to protect the interests of law-abiding citizens. He has announced a series of new measures that will be put into place to enforce New York's gambling laws.

These measures include increased funding for law enforcement, more aggressive investigation and prosecution of illegal gambling operations, and enhanced cooperation between law enforcement agencies. The Governor also announced a new task force that will be responsible for coordinating enforcement efforts and developing strategies to combat illegal gambling.

The task force will be led by Daniel Castle, the Deputy Secretary for Public Safety. Castle brings over 25 years of experience in law enforcement to the role, and is well-equipped to lead this important effort.

The task force will work closely with all relevant law enforcement agencies, including the New York State Police, the FBI, and the IRS. It will also work with key stakeholders such as casino operators and gaming industry experts. This will ensure that all aspects of the illegal gambling industry are targeted in the crackdown.

The Governor is confident that these new measures will help to reduce crime and corruption in New York, and protect the interests of law-abiding citizens.

#  FBI Busts Large-Scale Gambling Operation in New York

The FBI has busted a large-scale gambling operation in New York. The illegal operation was run out of a warehouse in the Bronx, and involved more than $50 million in illegal bets.

Ten people have been arrested in connection with the gambling ring, including the alleged ringleaders, two brothers named Sammy and Alex Cohen. The Cohens are both well-known figures in the New York gambling scene, and are believed to have been running the operation for more than a decade.

According to investigators, the Cohen brothers were running several different sports betting operations, as well as a high-stakes poker game. They are also alleged to have ties to several organized crime families in New York City.

The FBI began investigating the Cohen brothers after receiving a tip from an informant. Over the course of their investigation, agents intercepted numerous phone calls and text messages between the suspects that detailed the workings of the gambling ring.

The arrests come as a major blow to New York's gambling scene, which has long been dominated by the Cohen brothers. It is also likely to send shockwaves through organized crime circles in the city.
