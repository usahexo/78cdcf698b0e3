#  Get Ready for the Blackjack 3 Hand Game at the Casino

The Blackjack 3 Hand casino game is a great new option for players who want to enjoy the excitement of blackjack while managing more hands at the same time. The game is played with three hands instead of one, and the player can bet on each hand individually or all three at once.

The object of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. The dealer will draw cards until they have 17 or more, and must hit on 16 or less. In Blackjack 3 Hand, each player gets their own cards and then shares them with the other two hands. So if you get an ace and a king in your first two cards, you might want to split them up between all three hands rather than risk having one of them busted.

One thing to keep in mind is that you still only get one card per hand when you split, so if you split two aces then you'll only get one more card for each hand. If the card is a 10 or an ace, then you might want to consider doubling down instead, since that would give you two shots at getting closer to 21.

There are some other basic rules that stay the same in Blackjack 3 Hand as in regular blackjack. You can't hit on anything below 16, for example, and if you bust then your hand is automatically over. And like most blackjack games, dealers must stand on 17 or higher.

If you're looking for a new way to enjoy blackjack, then be sure to check out Blackjack 3 Hand at your favorite casino. With three hands to bet on instead of just one, it offers more excitement and potential rewards than ever before!
