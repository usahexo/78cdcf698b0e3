#  How to Spot a Gambling Addict Slot Machines

Slot machines are one of the most popular gambling games in the world. However, for some people, they can be a dangerous addiction. So how do you know if someone is addicted to slot machines?

There are a few key signs to look out for. One is if someone is spending an excessive amount of money on slots. Gambling addicts often try to chase their losses by betting more and more money, which can quickly spiral out of control.

Another sign is if someone is exhibiting compulsive behaviour around slot machines. This might include staying up late or skipping work or other activities in order to gamble. Addicts can also become very possessive about their machine and may not want anyone else to use it.
