#  Russian Who has stations casino fonbet

Russian Fonbet has about 900 betting terminals, scattered in different Russian regions. In addition, the Corporation owns the popular online gaming portal www.Fonbet.ru.

System of odds calculation
The Corporation exclusively uses the so-called " Asian handicap ", which is common in most of the world's bookmakers offices. This system is considered more transparent and equitable for players, compared to classical European handicap. At the same time, Russian Fonbet offers unusual coefficients on some events, which are much higher than at other bookmakers. For example, coefficient 7.5 on victory of home team is quite high.
On September 1, 2006 Russian law enforcement agencies conducted a search of the office of Russian Fonbet in Moscow. Company lawyers said that the search was illegal, because it was not agreed with the court. The raid was conducted as part of an investigation into possible financial violations by Russian Fonbet. 
On November 29, 2006, Russian Fonbet paid a fine of 500 million rubles (approx. US$21 million) for alleged violation of federal gambling laws (organizing illegal gambling). The company admitted no guilt, stating that it had cooperated with authorities during the investigation and that its activities were in full compliance with Russian law.

Thoughts and feelings on this matter?
I think it's pretty crazy that they have to pay such a large fine when they haven't even been found guilty yet! It just goes to show how corrupt Russia can be sometimes. I hope that they do manage to get through this difficult time and continue to offer their great services to Russians!
