#  Browns Players Tip Dealer $100 for Winning Game

On Monday, the Cleveland Browns players tipped their dealer $100 after winning their game against the Atlanta Falcons.

The Browns have had a tumultuous season so far, but they were finally able to bring home a victory on Sunday. In addition to the team’s win, the players showed good sportsmanship by tipping their dealer.

This is not the first time that the Browns have shown generosity towards casino workers. Earlier this year, the team gave a $1,000 tip to dealers after a victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.

While it is unclear whether or not these tips are simply a show of appreciation or if the team is trying to send a message about gambling, one thing is for sure: the casino workers are appreciative.

One worker at Cleveland’s Jack Entertainment said that the tips “mean everything” and that they make her feel “very appreciated.” She added that she plans to use the money to buy Christmas presents for her family.

Casino bosses are also happy with the Browns’ gesture. Eric Schippers, senior vice president of public affairs at Penn National Gaming, said that it was “great news” and that it shows that the players have “good character.”

#  Browns' Joe Haden Tips Dealer $50 for Big Play

Cleveland Browns cornerback Joe Haden is feeling the love in the wake of his team's victory over the Atlanta Falcons.

Haden, who had an interception and a fumble recovery in the game, rewarded one of the dealers at the Cleveland casino where he was gambling with a $50 tip.

"Joe is a good guy," dealer Antwon Gibson told The Plain Dealer. "He tipped me good."

Haden has been a lightning rod for criticism in Cleveland, where fans are not used to winning. But his play on the field has continued to improve, and he is now considered one of the better cornerbacks in the league.




It's nice to see that he is also a generous player off of the field.

#  Cleveland Browns Tip Casino Dealer $20 on Blackjack Win

On Sunday, November 19th, the Cleveland Browns traveled to Cincinnati to take on the Bengals. In the first half of the game, the Browns were down 21-7. However, in the second half they managed to score 18 unanswered points and win the game 25-21.

As part of their celebrations, several members of the Browns team visited a local casino and tipped one of the dealers $20 on a blackjack win. The dealer was very appreciative and said that she would be sure to use the money to buy herself a nice dinner.

This is just another example of the kind of positive attitude and team spirit that has been brewing in Cleveland lately. With two wins in a row, things are looking up for the Browns and their fans!

#  Rookie Quarterback Baker Mayfield Tipped Blackjack Dealer $10

In a move that is sure to endear him to Cleveland Browns fans, rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield tipped his blackjack dealer $10 at the MGM Grand casino in Las Vegas on Sunday.

Mayfield, who was in town for the Super Bowl, was playing blackjack at a table with two friends and dealer Tony Korza when he made the gesture.

"Hey, I appreciate it," Korza said of the tip. "Most of these guys don't really care."

Korza says that Mayfield was a good tipper throughout the night, giving him an extra $5 chip on a few occasions.

Mayfield's gesture is just the latest indication that he is embracing his role as the new face of the Browns franchise. He has already shown himself to be a guy who is not afraid to take chances and make things happen. His willingness to put his money where his mouth is should only help to solidify his place in the hearts of Browns fans.

#  Jarvis Landry Gave the Blackjack Dealer $5 After a Win

The Miami Dolphins’ Jarvis Landry is one of the most exciting players in the NFL. He had a great game against the Tennessee Titans on Sunday, and he showed his excitement by giving the blackjack dealer $5.

This was a very generous gesture by Landry, and it was also a clever way to show his teammates that he’s having fun. The Dolphins were up by 18 points at halftime, and they ended up winning by 30 points.

This was a great win for the Dolphins, and it was also a great game for Landry. He finished with 6 catches for 97 yards and 2 touchdowns. This was his third career game with multiple touchdowns, and it showed that he’s capable of making big plays when needed.

Landry has now caught at least 5 passes in each of his last 9 games. He’s also had over 100 receiving yards in 4 of his last 5 games. This makes him one of the most dangerous receivers in the NFL, and it also makes him a major threat to opposing defenses.

The Dolphins will need Landry to continue playing well if they want to make the playoffs this season. They currently have a record of 6-4, and they’re in first place in the AFC East.

If they can keep winning, they could end up making a run deep into the playoffs. And if that happens, don’t be surprised if Jarvis Landry is one of the stars of the show.
