#  What are the latest trends in kids toys for 2022?

There are many new and upcoming trends in kids toys for the year 2022. Some of these include augmented reality, AI and voice-controlled toys, and more creative and open-ended toys.

One of the biggest toy trends for 2022 is going to be Augmented Reality (AR). AR is a technology that combines real-world objects with digital content, such as images, videos, or text. This allows users to interact with the digital content by using their surroundings as a backdrop. For example, you could point your phone’s camera at a building and see information about it pop up on the screen.

This technology is already being used in some toys, such as the Mattel View-Master VR Starter Pack. This pack comes with a View-Master VR viewer and a selection of experience discs that let you explore different virtual worlds. Other companies are also developing AR toys, so look out for these in the near future.

Another big trend for 2022 is AI (Artificial Intelligence). AI allows toys to learn and adapt to the child’s preferences and personality. For example, the FurReal Ricky robot dog is able to respond to over 100 voice commands, recognize different family members, and even play fetch.

AI toys are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to provide a more personal experience for children. They can also help teach children important skills such as problem-solving and creativity. Look out for more AI toys in the future!

A third trend for 2022 is voice-controlled toys. These are toys that can be controlled using voice commands instead of buttons or switches. The most popular voice-controlled toy at the moment is the Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition, which is a small speaker that responds to voice commands from Amazon's Alexa assistant.

Voice-controlled toys have several benefits over traditional toy controls. Firstly, they are easier for young children to use as they don’t need to learn how to use complicated buttons or switches. Secondly, they can help children develop their communication skills as they learn how to give clear instructions to the toy. Finally, they are fun and engaging for kids!

Other trends in kids toys for 2022 include:

#  What were some of the best-selling kids toys in 2021?

The best-selling toys for kids in 2021 were the usual mix of dolls, action figures, and video games. But there were a few surprises on the list, including a robotic dog that could be controlled with an app and a set of color-changing blocks.

The top-selling toy of the year was the Barbie Dreamhouse, which had been a perennial favorite for years. The Dreamhouse is a three-story mansion with numerous accessories, and it can be customized to fit each girl's individual style.

Another popular toy was the Hatchimals Surprise. These little creatures hatch from eggs, and each one is different. Kids can raise them and watch them grow, teaching them about the responsibilities of taking care of a pet.

The Luvabella doll was another bestseller. This interactive doll responds to touch and voice, making her feel like a real baby. She can even learn to speak new languages!

Other popular toys included the Lego Dimensions Starter Pack (a set of blocks that can be used to build various objects and structures), the NEOS360 robot pet (a robot dog that can be controlled with an app), and the Annoying Orange Slice Set (a set of color-changing blocks that makes irritating noises when you step on them).
